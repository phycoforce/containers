# AGENTS.md: containers

Guidance for AI coding agents (and humans) writing Go in this repository.
There's no application code here: Go exists solely to test the container
images this repo builds, via `testcontainers-go`. There's no `main.go`, no
config to load, no CLI, no server; everything below is specific to this
repo's own shape.

## Working in this repo: fork context, commits, and safety

This repo is a personal fork of
[home-operations/containers](https://github.com/home-operations/containers)
that keeps only the apps its owner uses (currently just `owncast`, which
upstream has deprecated — it is maintained here, not pulled from upstream).
Everything else mirrors upstream file-for-file except these deliberate
deltas, which a catchup must preserve:

- the Go module path (`github.com/phycoforce/containers`), and `go.sum`
  kept `go mod tidy`-clean rather than adopting upstream's stale entries;
- the Renovate `extends` preset (`github>phycoforce/renovate-config`);
- the LICENSE attribution;
- the `phycoforce` substitutions throughout `README.md` (badges, ghcr.io
  image names, links) — never take upstream's README verbatim;
- the `[settings.node] compile = false` mise setting AND the matching
  hand-inserted `[tools.node.options] compile = "false"` block in
  `.mise/mise.lock`, which keys the lockfile so CI's `--locked` install
  resolves node the same way as local runs — re-apply the lock block
  whenever upstream's regenerated lockfile is adopted;
- this file and `CLAUDE.md` (adapted, not upstream's);
- action pins where the fork's own Renovate is ahead of upstream — never
  downgrade a pinned action to match upstream.

Periodic "catchup" sessions diff the working tree against `upstream/main`
— the histories are unrelated, so compare content, not commits — and adopt
upstream's changes while preserving those deltas.

- PR titles follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
  `<type>[(scope)][!]: <description>`. Individual commit messages don't
  have to follow the format, though matching it is fine. Never add an AI
  co-author trailer.
- Never `git commit`, `git push`, or open a PR unless asked to. Ask before
  any destructive or hard-to-reverse action instead of defaulting to it.
- Don't state a library's API from memory: verify against `pkg.go.dev` or
  this project's own code, e.g. `tests/helpers.go`, before assuming a
  `testcontainers-go` helper exists or behaves a certain way.
- After a change, actually run the affected app's test (see "Running"
  below) before calling it done, and check `.github/workflows/` for what CI
  actually enforces beyond that (formatting, `go vet`, ...) rather than
  assuming.

## Layout

One `apps/<name>/container_test.go` per image, `package main`, testing the
image built from `apps/<name>/`. Shared helpers live in `tests/helpers.go`
(package `helpers`): check that file for what's already available (things
like `RequireCommandSucceeds`, `RequireHTTPEndpoint`, `RequireFileExists`
as of this writing) before hand-rolling container lifecycle code in an
individual `container_test.go`. Add a new capability to `helpers` instead;
that's the DRY boundary in this repo.

## Conventions

- `testify/require`, not `assert`: a failed image test should stop
  immediately rather than cascade into a second, confusing failure.
- Every helper takes `t *testing.T` first, calls `t.Helper()`, and
  registers cleanup via `testcontainers.CleanupContainer(t, c)`; never leak
  a container past the test.
- `TEST_IMAGE` overrides the default image under test
  (`helpers.GetTestImage`), so a local build task can point tests at a
  just-built image instead of the published tag; check `mise tasks` for the
  actual task name.
- Idempotent and side-effect-free: a test only asserts against the image
  under test (command exit code, HTTP response, file presence in the
  filesystem) and never depends on or mutates state from another test.
- Still idiomatic Go where it applies: `go vet`-clean, no unchecked errors
  outside the established `require.NoError` pattern, table-driven subtests
  (`t.Run`) if a single app's test grows multiple cases.
- `gofmt -s` runs via the shared `home-operations/.github` lefthook config
  on every staged `.go` file; check `.github/workflows/` for whatever else
  CI enforces (e.g. `go vet`) before assuming lefthook's formatting pass is
  the only gate.

## Running

Run `mise tasks` for the actual local build+test task name and invocation;
don't assume it matches another repo's, and don't assume CI selects which
apps to build from `.github/labeler.yaml`, that file drives PR labels only.
Check `.github/workflows/` for the step that actually selects changed apps.
